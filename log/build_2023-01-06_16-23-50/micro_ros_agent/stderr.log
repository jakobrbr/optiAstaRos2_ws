[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (tinyxml2)
  does not match the name of the calling package (TinyXML2).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:51 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmicro_ros_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "micro_ros_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "micro_ros_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    micro_ros_msgsConfig.cmake
    micro_ros_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "micro_ros_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "micro_ros_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "micro_ros_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
